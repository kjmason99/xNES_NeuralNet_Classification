# xNES_NeuralNet_Classification
This python project contains code capable of training a neural network for classification using the xNES (exponential Natural evolution strategy).

It contains two benchmark classification data sets: Iris and Seeds data sets.

The xnes.py file is the main python code that runs the xnes algorithm.

The NeuralNetworkClass.py file contains the neural network code that makes predictions of classes based on features input into the network.

The Utils.py file contains code necessary to read in and process the data sets mentioned.
